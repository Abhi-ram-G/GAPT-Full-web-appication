# Copilot Instructions for Backend

- This workspace uses a Node.js + Express backend structure.
- Follow industry-standard folder organization: controllers, models, routes, middlewares, services, utils, config, tests.
- Use Express for REST APIs, dotenv for environment variables, and nodemon for development.
- Place all backend code inside the backend/src directory.
- Use the package.json in backend/ for dependencies and scripts.
- See README.md for setup and usage instructions.
